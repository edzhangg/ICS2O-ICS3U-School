		<h3> <font size = 3> Tim Berners-Lee's Contributions to Computer Science: </font> </h3>
		<p> <u>Tim Berners-Lee</u> is known to be the inventor of the <b>World Wide Web</b>.When he was working at CERN (as a software engineer), 
		he designed and developed a procedure that allows computers to communicate with each other. 
		This was to provide researchers to share results, techniques, and practices without having to constantly send emails, 
		and can be accessed at anytime, anywhere. This would lead to the first web server being created. Then, he went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 
		to establish the World Wide Web, which billions of people use all over the world today.</p>
